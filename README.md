# introduction

**goals**

The goal is to have a software tool (hereafter named `mapit`, but the naming is under discussion!) for developing and visualizing graph representations of structured content (i.e., nested/hierarchical and connected).

There are obviously already a lot of tools for building graphs, but we want a tool specifically designed for:
* representing a single document with nested information;
* navigating information dynamically;
* native browser's support.

**motivation**

`mapit` is to be an alternative to the book format, in which content is presented necessarily in a sequential 1-dimensional fashion: one can stress the relationships between concepts (say, the motivation to some result, or the connections between some theorems), but the exposition format makes it hard both to emphasize these relationships, and virtually impossible to connect all the concepts - except through static diagrams, which are themselves necessarily limited.

For structured contents such as mathematics, this makes up for a poor medium for communication.

Once a person is acquainted with a subject, she doesn't think of it sequentially - it is even somewhat hard to collapse understanding into such a format, despite our being used to it - so why use this format to present material to newcomers?
