>>> 1. GOAL <<<

    Provide a graph representation for communicating and digesting structured information.

    The primary example of its applications is the communication of mathematical content - as in, say, Trigonometry.
    But it should in principle be applicable to any subject/topic/domain that benefits from a principled representation of its contents and connections.


>>> 2. CONTEXT <<<

    >> 2.1 PROBLEMS TO SOLVE

        >> 2.1.1 IN MATHEMATICS

        When we consider traditional ways of presenting mathematical content - such as books and video/live ones -,
        they lack structure in themselves, i.e., they are fundamentally sequential, 1-dimensional.

        This obviously doesn't mean one cannot stress the connections between two, three or four concepts or theorems,
        it just means that the whole of connections cannot be presented in such a way as to lend them easily revisitable and automatically perceived.

        And when you have a structure-ridden field of subjects, such as mathematics,
        finding the best way to communicate the connections between concepts seems fundamental.


        >> 2.1.2 IN GENERAL

        One can extend this concern to other subjects, such as physics, biology, chemistry, engineering or even languages (natural or artificial).

        In essence, it can be extended to every subject that may be regarded as a structured building.

    >> 4.1 PRINCIPLES

    >> 4.2 COMPONENTS:


        * each document [representing a subject (e.g., Geometry, Calculus)] is a stack of sheets [representing topics (e.g., Lines and Angles, Poligons, Trigonometry)];
        
        * each sheet is composed of connected nodes;
        
        * nodes in a given sheet may be connected to nodes in other sheets (say, trigonometric functions, represented in Calculus, are connected to trigonometric rules, in Trigonometry);
        
        * a node must have:
            * a type; for example, in a mathematics document:
                * a topic
                * an observation
                * a provocation
                * a definition
                * a proposition
                * a theorem
                * an exercise
                * an example
            * a name; for example:
                * the topic
                * the concept being defined
                * the name of the theorem
                * the numbering of the exercise
                * etc
            * optional content determined by its type; for example:
                * for a proposition, it could be its assumptions, its statement(s), and optionally an image


        * a connection is established between (potentially multiple) input nodes and an output node

        * a connection must have a type, e.g., for a mathematics document:
            * a motivation
            * a consequence
            * an equivalence
            * a corolary
            * a generalization
        
        * a connection can also have some content, say, a text
